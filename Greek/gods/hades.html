            <p>Guardian of the Underworld</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Origin of Hades">
            <h2>Origin of Hades</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Birth and Early Life</h3>
            <p>Hades was the eldest son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, and like his siblings, he was swallowed by his father at birth. After Zeus rescued him and the other siblings, Hades fought alongside them in the Titanomachy, a war that resulted in the defeat of the Titans.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Division of the Cosmos</h3>
            <p>After their victory over the Titans, Hades and his brothers, Zeus and Poseidon, divided the world among themselves. Hades became the ruler of the underworld, governing over the realm of the dead. Though his dominion was grim, Hades was not viewed as malevolent but rather as a stern and just ruler.</p>

        <section id="2. Role in Greek Mythology">
            <h2>2. Role in Greek Mythology</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Lord of the Dead</h3>
            <p>Hades governed the underworld, a shadowy realm where souls went after death. He ensured that the dead remained in his domain, never to return to the world of the living. The underworld was also home to the rivers Styx, Acheron, and Lethe, as well as the Elysian Fields and Tartarus.</p>
            <h3>2.2 God of Wealth</h3>
            <p>Hades was also associated with wealth, as all precious metals and gems came from beneath the earth. His name is often connected to "Plouton," meaning "wealthy," indicating his dominion over both the dead and the riches buried deep in the ground.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Hades's Relationships</h3>
            <p>Hades's most well-known relationship is with Persephone, whom he abducted and made his queen. This myth explains the cycle of seasons, as Persephone spends part of the year in the underworld (autumn and winter) and part with her mother, Demeter (spring and summer).</p>

        <section id="3. Iconography and Symbols">
            <h2>3. Iconography and Symbols</h2>
            <p>Hades is often depicted as a dark, stern figure. His symbols include:

                <li>Helmet of Invisibility: A gift from the Cyclopes, used by Hades to move unseen.</li>
                <li>Cerberus: The three-headed dog that guarded the gates of the underworld, preventing souls from escaping.</li>
                <li>Cypress Tree: A symbol of mourning and the afterlife, associated with Hades.</li>
                <li>Bident: A two-pronged spear, symbolizing his authority over the underworld.</li></p>

        <section id="4. Cult and Worship of Hades">
            <h2>4. Cult and Worship of Hades</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Major Temples and Sanctuaries</h3>
            <p>Hades had few temples compared to other gods, as he was not widely worshipped in the same way. People feared invoking his name, preferring euphemisms like "Plouton" instead. However, there were some significant sanctuaries:

                <li>Elis: A sanctuary where Hades and Persephone were worshipped together, particularly during festivals connected to the cycle of life and death.</li>
                <li>Epirus: The Necromanteion, an ancient temple for communicating with the dead, was believed to be an entrance to Hades's realm.</li></p>
            <h3>4.2 Festivals and Rituals</h3>
            <p>Festivals honoring Hades were rare, though the Anthesteria, a festival dedicated to the dead, paid tribute to him. The Eleusinian Mysteries, though primarily honoring Demeter and Persephone, also acknowledged Hadesâ€™s role in the cycle of life and death.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="5. Hades in Myth">
            <h2>5. Hades in Literature and Myth</h2>
            <p>Hades appears in many Greek myths, often as a background figure ensuring the dead remained in his realm:

                <li>The Myth of Persephone: The most famous myth involving Hades, it explains the changing seasons and highlights Hades's love for Persephone.</li>
                <li>Heracles's Twelfth Labor: Heracles had to enter the underworld and capture Cerberus, Hades's faithful guardian.</li></p>
            <p>In both cases, Hades is portrayed as a powerful but mostly passive figure, ruling his domain with quiet authority.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="6. Hades in Roman Mythology">
            <h2>6. Hades in Roman Mythology</h2>
            <p>In Roman mythology, Hades was known as Pluto. Much like his Greek counterpart, Pluto ruled over the dead and was associated with wealth. He remained an important figure in Roman religion, particularly in funeral rites and beliefs surrounding the afterlife.</p>

            <p>Hades has appeared in modern retellings of Greek myths, including:</p>
            <li>"Percy Jackson & the Olympians" by Rick Riordan: Hades is portrayed as an outcast god, living in the underworld and sometimes clashing with the other Olympians.</li>
            <li>"Lore Olympus": A modern webcomic where Hades is a central character, depicted in a more sympathetic light with a focus on his relationship with Persephone.</li>
