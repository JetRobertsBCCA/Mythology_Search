        <section id="Origin of Poseidon">
            <h2>Origin of Poseidon</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Birth and Early Life</h3>
            <p>Poseidon, like his brothers Zeus and Hades, was one of the Olympian gods born to Cronus and Rhea. Like his siblings, he was swallowed by Cronus at birth and later freed by Zeus. Poseidon was destined to rule the seas, with dominion over all water bodies.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Division of the World</h3>
            <p>After the defeat of the Titans, Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades divided the realms of the cosmos. Poseidon claimed the seas, where he ruled with absolute authority, commanding the oceans, storms, and earthquakes. Though his realm was separate from the heavens and the underworld, Poseidon was a powerful and sometimes tempestuous god.</p>

            <h2>2. Role in Greek Mythology</h2>
            <h3>2.1 God of the Sea</h3>
            <p>Poseidon was revered as the god of the seas, rivers, and all bodies of water. Sailors prayed to him for safe voyages, while his temper was known to cause shipwrecks, tsunamis, and devastating floods. His trident was said to be capable of stirring the oceans or calming them at will.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Earth-Shaker</h3>
            <p>In addition to ruling the seas, Poseidon was also the god of earthquakes, known as the "Earth-Shaker." When angry, he would strike the ground with his trident, causing tremors and massive destruction. This dual nature as both sea god and Earth-shaker made Poseidon one of the most feared deities.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Poseidon's Relationships</h3>
            <p>Poseidon had many relationships with both goddesses and mortals. His most famous consort was Amphitrite, a sea nymph, with whom he fathered Triton, a merman. He also had numerous mortal children, including Theseus, the legendary hero of Athens.</p>
