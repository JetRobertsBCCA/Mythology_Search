        <section id="Origin of Zeus">
            <h2>Origin of Zeus</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Birth and Early Life</h3>
            <p>Zeus was the youngest child of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. According to Greek mythology, Cronus, fearing that one of his children would overthrow him, swallowed each of them upon birth. Rhea, however, hid Zeus on the island of Crete and tricked Cronus by giving him a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Raised by the nymph Amalthea, Zeus grew in secret, biding his time to rescue his siblings.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Zeus Overthrows Cronus</h3>
            <p>When Zeus came of age, he forced Cronus to regurgitate his siblings: Hestia, Hera, Demeter, Poseidon, and Hades. Together, they fought against Cronus and the Titans in the epic conflict known as the Titanomachy. After their victory, Zeus and his brothers, Poseidon and Hades, divided the universe, with Zeus becoming the ruler of the sky and king of the gods.</p>
